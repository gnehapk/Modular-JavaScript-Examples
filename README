This assignment is designed to test your client-side coding skills and show us
what youâ€™re good at! You can add or modify any of the JavaScript, HTML and CSS
to complete the assignment. JQuery has been included for your convenience, but
is not required. Please do not use jQuery plugins. Also avoid frameworks like
Angular and Backbone. Please make sure the page works as a static page without
the need to run a web server or a build script.

First, prioritize the list of tasks below from high to low (1 -> top priority,
7-> lowest priority). Please explain why you choose to prioritize this way,
and what you considered when assigning high or low priority to each task.

Second, pick one or two tasks out of the list and implement them. You may choose
whatever task you prefer that you think will best reflect your coding skills.

Tasks
========================================

 *  Imagine there's a json feed with hotels similar to the current one. Design
	the json format and use it to display similar hotels on the page.

 *  Imagine there's a json feed with nearby landmarks. Design the json format
	and use it to display landmarks on the page.

	the rooms table by occupancy or price, display a total when the user selects
	a quantity, display additional information about rooms.

	currently in the page. Some ideas you may consider: include an automatic
